## Introduction to the Project

In this notebook, I have used the [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a [universal tagset](http://www.petrovi.de/data/universal.pdf). Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more.

## Installation
You require following modules to run the [notebook](https://github.com/hjain5164/Udacity-NLP-Nanodegree/blob/master/Part%20of%20Speech%20Tagger%20using%20HMM%20-%20Project%20Work-2/HMM%20Tagger.ipynb):
* matplotlib
* pomegranate
* numpy
* nltk

There is a warmup notebook which will help you to understand the HMM models.
You may ignore the other files as they were part of the submission on Udacity's Platform.
