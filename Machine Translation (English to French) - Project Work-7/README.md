## Introduction to the Project
In this notebook, I have built a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline accepts English text as input and return the French translation.

## Installation
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 1.x
- Keras 2.x
