## Introduction to the Project
In this notebook, I have built a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline! The completed pipeline will accept raw audio as input and return a predicted transcription of the spoken language. In this capstone project, 5 RNN architectures are used and compared with each other. The full pipeline is summarized in the figure below.
