## Udacity-NLP-Nanodegree
This repository contains the project work done as part of the NLP Nanodegree program offered by Udacity.

This Nanodegree program helps to learn cutting-edge natural language processing techniques to process speech and analyze text. The program helps to Build probabilistic and deep learning models, such as hidden Markov models and recurrent neural networks, to teach the computer to do tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and more!
