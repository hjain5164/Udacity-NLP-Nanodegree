## Introduction to the Project

In this notebook, I have build a recurrent neural network and trained it to decipher strings encrypted with a certain cipher.
The RNN was able to learn the basic character-level cipher (which was a simple Caesar cipher). If you want a bigger cryptography challenge, check out [Learning the Enigma with Recurrent Neural Networks](https://greydanus.github.io/2017/01/07/enigma-rnn/).

## Installation
You require following modules to run the [notebook](https://github.com/hjain5164/Udacity-NLP-Nanodegree/blob/master/Deciphering%20Code%20with%20Character-Level%20RNN%20-%20Project%20Work-6/SOLUTION%20Deciphering%20Code%20with%20Character-Level%20RNN.ipynb):
* keras
* numpy
