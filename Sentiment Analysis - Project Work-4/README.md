## Introduction to the Project

With the rise of online social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, and the proliferation of customer reviews on sites like Amazon and Yelp, we now have access, more than ever before, to massive text-based data sets! They can be analyzed in order to determine how large portions of the population feel about certain products, events, etc. This sort of analysis is called sentiment analysis. In this notebook I have build an end-to-end sentiment classification system from scratch.

In this project, I have used two techniques to build a sentiment analyzer:
1. Using GradientBoostClassifier from sklearn
2. Recurrent Neural Networks using keras

## Installation
